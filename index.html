        Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the
        first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The
        3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by
        itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup
        illustration below.
